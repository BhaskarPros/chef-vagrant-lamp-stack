# Hello
This repo consists of the files used in my [blog posts](http://robinosborne.co.uk/category/environment-automation/) on creating a LAMP stack using Chef Solo, Vagrant, and Virtualbox.

In order to run this straight away, not only will you need Vagrant and Virtualbox installed, but you'll need to create a *cookbooks* directory and fill it with the Apache, PHP, MySQL, Database, OpenSSL, and Build-Essentials cookbooks from the OpsCode github repo.
